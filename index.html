    <h3 id="four">Team History</h3>
    <p> Tottenham Hotspur football club is an English soccer team that was formed in 1882. The team is based out of Tottenham, London and played in the southern league division until 1908 when they were promoted to Football League Second Division, this league being the main football league for England. The team was then promoted to the first division known now as “The Premier League” immediately after their first season in the second division with a second place finish. This same year the club was able to purchase the ground that has housed their stadium to this day. However, after this success the team saw poor results between 1910-1915 and were at the bottom of the league in 1915 when the league was suspended. When the league restarted in 1919 the first division was expanded to 22 teams instead of 20. Chelsea, team relegated with Tottenham, and Arsenal, a controversial pick over Tottenham, took the two added spots in the first division. This is what solidified the fierce rivalry between the Hotspur and the Arsenal Gunners. After this point the team fell into a very volatile positon in the league going up and down between divisions having great success followed by decline. Starting from the 1978-1979 Tottenham have been in the first division of the English league and have continued to have a strong presence in the league. 
    <br><br>
    Since the Teams formation the club has won two league championships, eight FA Cup titles, One European Cup title, Two UEFA Cup championships, and two division two Championships.
